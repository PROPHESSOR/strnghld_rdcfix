Notes of things to do in PK3

Following textures in textures/ are redundant. Simplify to one texture using TEXTURES lump.

	pipesh1.png
	pipesh2.png
Also some redundancy:
	n_warn??.png

Split up decorate.txt file more.
Remove all references to sprite "NULL A" and replace with "TNT1 A", the real boom-standard null sprite.
--DONE--

Remove A_ChangeFlag("ACTIVATEMCROSS",0) from all monsters' death states, as it is no longer needed.
(The deadline does a health check on the activator now.)
--DONE--

Make sure all monsters call A_GiveToTarget("CoinItem", 5) at the very beginning of their Death/XDeath
states, so that way the reward is immediate (especially for when time is frozen).
--DONE--

NightmareDemon is broken. Where's ACS script 200 and 201? (Now in sthldcmn.acs, incomplete)
REALLY IMPORTANT: Make sure all deadlines are ACS_Execute(255,0,0), monster activated,
and _repeatable action_ !
STR14 needs more ammo.

Change level breaktime to happen between wave actions and spawns, and enemy spawning,
instead of between waves.
--DONE--

Fix the font: 5 and 6, comma and period look too similar.

Make use of language lump for possible future translations.
